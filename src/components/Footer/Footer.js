                    Debt Consolidation Texas, Credit Counseling Texas, and Debt Relief Texas Consultations are Free of Charge with no obligation. Affordable Debt Consolidation is not a lender but offers a platform to receive offers from participating lenders. Debt enrolled in credit counseling generally receives an interest rate between 6% and 11%. Debt negotiation clients who make their scheduled monthly program payments generally experience an approximate 45% reduction of their enrolled balance before fees or approximately a 30% reduction after payment of settlement fees of 15% over an estimated 24-48 month period. Settlement fees and estimates do not include a $9.95 a month special purpose account fee or any optional and separate services such as those provided by Texas attorneys. Individual results vary based on the ability to fund the program and the creditors enrolled. Statements made are examples of past performance and are not intended to guarantee that your balances will be reduced by a specific amount or that you will resolve debt within a specific time period. We do not charge settlement fees until a debt balance is reduced and at least one payment is made to the creditor. We do not assume consumer debt, make monthly payments, or provide tax or legal advice. We are not a credit repair firm. Please contact a tax professional to discuss any possible tax consequences of paying less than the full balance. Programs are available in Texas. Affordable Debt Consolidation is a DBA of Debt Redemption Inc. registered with the Texas Secretary of State.</p>
